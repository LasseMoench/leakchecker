# Facebook Leak Checker
This script takes the facebook leak as a txt file and your phone contacts in vcard format and prints out a list of all your contacts that are affected by the leak so you can inform them.
### How to export phone contacts on Android
1. Open your contacts app
2. Tap settings icon (three dots in the corner)
3. Choose accounts to export contacts from
4. Tap export to vcf
### Where do I get the leak data?
I am not going to give instructions on this. You don't need them to check your own phone number, just use https://haveibeenpwned.com.
